# CCXT Python: Exploring Cryptocurrency Trading on Binance, Kucoin, and Bitmex

CCXT (CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading) is a popular open-source Python library that provides a unified API to interact with numerous cryptocurrency exchanges. It simplifies the process of accessing market data, executing trades, and managing accounts across multiple exchanges, making it easier for developers to build cryptocurrency trading applications.

CCXT supports a wide range of exchanges, including major platforms like Binance, Kucoin, and Bitmex. In this article, we will focus on these three exchanges, providing coding examples to replicate major functionalities needed by a trading bot.

### Setting Margin and Leverage

Setting margin and leverage differs across exchanges. For Binance and Bitmex, you can use the following code:

```python
exchange.set_margin_mode(symbol=symbol, marginMode="isolated", params={"type": "future"})
exchange.set_leverage(symbol=symbol, leverage=3, params={"type": "future"})
```

For Kucoin, margin and leverage are specified directly while creating the order.

### Handling Quantity Precision

Quantity precision varies among exchanges, so it's essential to manage it accordingly. Here's an example:

```python
balance = exchange.fetch_balance({"type": "future", "marginType": "isolated"})
to_risk_balance = round(balance * 0.1, 2)  # Risking 10% of your balance
quantity = (to_risk_balance * leverage) / close
market = exchange.market(symbol)
quantity = int(quantity * float(market["info"].get("underlyingToPositionMultiplier", 1)))
quantity = exchange.amount_to_precision(symbol, quantity)
```

### Taking Long and Short Trades

To take long or short trades, it's recommended to use the `create_order` function with the appropriate arguments. Here are the examples:

Binance:

```python
long = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'market', 'buy', quantity, None)
```

Kucoin:

```python
long = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'market', 'buy', quantity, None, {"marginMode": "isolated", "leverage": leverage})
```

Bitmex:

```python
long = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'market', 'buy', quantity, None, {"leverage": leverage})
```

Note: For short positions, replace `'buy'` with `'sell'`, and adjust the quantity and prices accordingly.

### Setting Take Profit and Stop Loss Orders

Setting take profit (TP) and stop loss (SL) orders also varies across exchanges. Here are the examples:

Binance (TP):

```python
tp = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET', 'sell', quantity, None, {"stopPrice": tp_price, "reduceOnly": True})
```

Kucoin (TP):

```python
tp = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'market', 'sell', quantity, None, {"stopPrice": tp_price, "stop": "up", "reduceOnly": True})
```

Bitmex (TP):

```python
tp = exchange.create_order(symbol, 'MarketIfTouched', 'sell', quantity, tp_price, {"stopPx": tp_price, "execInst": "ReduceOnly"})
```

Similar examples can be used for setting stop loss (SL) orders.

### Closing Positions and Open Orders

Closing open orders is straightforward. Fetch open orders and cancel the desired order:

```python

open_orders =exchange.fetch_open_orders(symbol)

for open_order in open_orders:
    # Condition to check which order to cancel
    exchange.cancel_order(open_order["id"], open_order["symbol"])
```

## Conclusion

CCXT Python is a powerful library that simplifies cryptocurrency trading by providing a unified API for multiple exchanges. By leveraging its features and the coding examples provided, you can develop your own cryptocurrency trading strategies across different platforms.
